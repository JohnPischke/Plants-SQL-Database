# Overview

The software that I created is a simple editor for the plants.db database that I created. This software uses the sqlite3 library of python to edit and display the contents of the database. The software gives you a set of options to choose from to see or edit the database. 

The purpose of this software was to become familiar with SQL Relational Databases. Another purpose of this software was to practice and learn the use of the sqlite3 library of python, as well as the creation of a simple database.
